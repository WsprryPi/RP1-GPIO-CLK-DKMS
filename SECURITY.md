# Security policy

Installation and build success do not qualify a kernel, route, or physical RF
setup. Operations require authorization for the actual system and configuration.
See [qualification boundaries](engineering/operations/qualification-metadata.md).

Report a suspected vulnerability privately through GitHub's security advisory
feature for `WsprryPi/RP1-GPIO-CLK-DKMS`. Do not include sensitive details in a
public issue.

Security-sensitive areas include:

- UAPI validation and device-node permissions;
- integer bounds, structure sizes, and userspace memory handling;
- DMA destination derivation and transfer bounds;
- clock, pinctrl, DMA, and platform-resource ownership;
- process death, cancellation, callbacks, unbind, and module lifetime;
- signing, DKMS installation, update, rollback, and removal;
- compatibility-manifest and release-artifact integrity; and
- any condition that could leave a GPIO or clock active after failure.

Do not attempt live exploitation, module loading, GPIO manipulation, or RF
testing on systems you do not own or lack explicit authorization to test.
